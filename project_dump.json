Slotted above the consumer-oriented Ford F-150, the Super Duty trucks are an expansion of the Ford F-Series range, from the F-250 to the F-550. Rather than adapting lighter-duty trucks for heavier use, Super Duty trucks have been designed as a dedicated variant of the Ford F-Series, including pickup trucks and chassis cab vehicles; the Ford F-450 is the largest pickup truck offered for sale in North America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently in their fourth generation, Super Duty trucks use a separate chassis from the F-150, including heavier-duty frame and chassis components, which allows for heavier payloads and towing capabilities. With a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_vehicle_weight_rating\" title=\"Gross vehicle weight rating\">GVWR</a>&nbsp;over 8,500&nbsp;lb (3,900&nbsp;kg), Super Duty pickups are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck_classification\" title=\"Truck classification\">Class 2 and 3</a>&nbsp;trucks; chassis cab trucks are offered in Class 4 and 5 sizes. The model line also offers&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Power_Stroke_engine\" title=\"Ford Power Stroke engine\">Ford PowerStroke</a>&nbsp;V8 diesel engines as an option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alongside pickup trucks and chassis cabs, the Super Duty line includes medium-duty F-Series trucks (F-650 and F-750); the Super Duty pickup truck also served as the basis for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Excursion\" title=\"Ford Excursion\">Ford Excursion</a>&nbsp;full-sized SUV.</p>",
